# my-exercises-solution-coding events

1)Purpose:
The purpose of this app is to track all events in a given area.  People can add, delete, or edit their events.  They can 
provide descriptions and hashtags in order to promote the event.

2)Current State of App:
Currently, a user is able to add, list, or delete events.  I am working on the edit features in order to make any changes to 
events already listed.  There is an ability to add hashtags to link events with the same themes together.  This however still 
needs work.

3)Future of the App:
I would like to implement a Person object to this app.  It will contain some personal information of the person; name, email,
past events attended, future events, along with interests.  I will have to implement a seperate controller to handle requests 
for this Person object, as well as stored data regaurding the person's criteria.
